# Strategic Business Recommendations

1. Prioritize high profit sub-categories.These categories deliver consistent margins and demand. Focus inventory, marketing and pricing strategy on:

- Binders
- Paper
- Furnishings

2. Evaluate or replace loss-making products: Consider renegotiating supplier contracts, discontinuing low-margin products  or repricing with value-added bundles. Products such as copiers should be reviewed for:

- High return rates
- High shipping or warranty costs
- Supplier issues
- Pricing not covering costs

3. Upsell/Bundle low-engagement categories. Accessories, Labels and Phones can be bundled with high-performing categories as:

- Office Starter Kits
- Administrative Packs
- Back-to-School Supplies Kits

4. Strengthen Corporate Sales, since corporate clients drive most revenue:

- Introduce tiered corporate loyalty programs
- Offer volume-based discounts
- Provide subscription-based office supplies replenishment

5. Grow Home Office market:

- Promote ergonomic furniture bundles
- Target remote workers on social media
- Offer flexible payment and free-return policies

6. Support Small Business growth

- Provide starter packages for new businesses
- Offer small-business credit terms
- Introduce low-cost shipping tiers

7. Invest in Northwest, Nunavut & Atlantic by:

- Increasing stock availability
- Boost targeted marketing
- Expand shipping centers or partnerships

8. Investigate low-performing regions. Explore local partnerships,reduce shipping costs with regional hubs and test localized product catalog. Quebec and Yukon may suffer from:

- Poor logistics coverage
- Competition with local suppliers
- Low demand for premium products

9. Optimize Regular Air costs. Since most customers prefer Regular Air, focus on reducing its cost through better carrier contracts, packaging efficiencies and predictive batching

- Offer attractive alternatives (Not Forced): Provide incentives for choosing Delivery Truck for customers who don’t require immediate delivery, while keeping Regular Air as the default
- Control Express Air for margin protection: Reserve Express Air for urgent or high-value orders and limit free usage through loyalty tiers or minimum purchase thresholds

# Overall Business Impact

By leveraging strongest product categories, optimizing logistics, expanding high-performing regions and diversifying the customer base, the company would significantly improve both profit margin and revenue growth over the next fiscal period
